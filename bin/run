# this is called the 'shebang' line.  It makes our file run smoothly.  With the proper config we should be able to run the file without typing 'ruby' first.
#!/usr/bin/env ruby 

# notice the the 'run' file doesn't have an extension of '.rb'.  That makes it an executable file.

# require_relative '../lib/garden.rb'   #this was not commented-out originally, we did it to pass the tests.  Instead, we pass in config/environment path to fufill 'require_relative'
# require_relative '../lib/plant.rb'

# require necessary 'lib' files to run our application.  If we add more files, we have to require them.

# now we can run some simple instances

lawn = Garden.new(name: 'Front Lawn')

basil = Plant.new(name: 'Basil')
basil.garden = lawn

cucumber = Plant.new(name: 'Cucumber')
cucumber.garden = lawn

p lawn.plants

#============================================================================================
# if we have test files, we have to 'require' the 'lib' files in there too.  So instead of having to do twice the work, we create a 'environment.rb' file (in the 'config' folder)that does the 'require' once, then company the environment path into this bin file:

#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require_relative '../config/environment'

# lawn = Garden.new(name: 'Front Lawn')

# basil = Plant.new(name: 'Basil')
# basil.garden = lawn

# cucumber = Plant.new(name: 'Cucumber')
# cucumber.garden = lawn

# p lawn.plants

#==========================================================================

# this goes in the config/environment.rb file:
# require_relative '../lib/garden'
# require_relative '../lib/plant'

# this is also a great place to configure access to a database.
